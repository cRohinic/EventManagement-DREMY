# Dreamy 🎉 — Event Management Web App

**Dreamy** is an event management web application that I’ve built from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It represents more than just a project—it's the foundation of my dream to create a full-scale, user-friendly platform that helps people plan and manage events effortlessly.
